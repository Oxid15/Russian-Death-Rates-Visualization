# Russian-Death-Rates-Visualization
###  What causes the death of different age groups?  
Here is the source code for my data analysis project that was made for [publication](https://ourcountryindata.ru/samye-chastye-prichiny-smerti-v-zavisimosti-ot-vozrasta-i-pola/) in OurCountryInData website.  

This notebook is based on the work that was done and represents all the steps and difficulties that I've got through when I worked on this project. The main question was like this in the title. What causes the death of different age groups in Russia? What trends we can explore now, what current data can tell us about the reasons of all fatal cases in our country? Here, in this notebook I describe the technical part of the question. Sort of **how** do we get answers, but not the answers itself. The particular answers could be found in the publication, it has all the plots that we got (in Russian).
